**Project Context**

This project analyzes and optimizes ICU Length of Stay (LOS) and patient access at Hospital da Criança de Brasília (HCB), a leading pediatric hospital in Brazil. The aim is to identify key factors influencing LOS and develop strategies to improve ICU efficiency and access for children in critical care.  

**Background**

Founded by ABRACE, a nonprofit supporting families of children with cancer, HCB has grown into a multidisciplinary pediatric center serving over 400,000 patients annually. The hospital operates entirely within Brazil’s public healthcare system (SUS) and includes outpatient services, inpatient care, an ICU, and a research center. It is managed by the Institute of Childhood Cancer and Specialized Pediatrics (ICIPE) in partnership with government and philanthropic organizations.  

**Objectives**  

**1. Understand ICU LOS**  
- Identify variables influencing LOS  
- Benchmark best practices through literature review  
- Map and assess data sources  
- Develop SOPs and gather staff insights  

**2. Improve ICU Access**  
- Analyze ICU workflows and identify inefficiencies  
- Map required resources and process flows  
- Calculate ICU capacity to enhance patient flow
